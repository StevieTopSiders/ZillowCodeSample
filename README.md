# ZillowCodeSample
A code sample I completed for an internship application at Zillow.

The prompt:

Question 1) Given a string, write a routine that converts the string to a long, without using the 

built in functions that would do this. Describe what (if any) limitations the code has. For 

example:

long stringToLong(String s)

{

 /* code goes here to convert a string to a long */

}

void test()

{ 

 long i = stringToLong("123");

 if (i == 123)

 // success

 else

 // failure

}

Question 2) Implement insert and delete in a tri-nary tree. A tri-nary tree is much like a binary 

tree but with three child nodes for each parent instead of two -- with the left node being values 

less than the parent, the right node values greater than the parent, and the middle nodes values 

equal to the parent.

For example, suppose I added the following nodes to the tree in this order: 5, 4, 9, 5, 7, 2, 2. 

The resulting tree would look like this:

 5

 / | \

 4 5 9

 / /

 2 7

 |

 2
